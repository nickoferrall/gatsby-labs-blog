{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Accomplishments this week</h3>\n<p>This week our team planned what we will do for the 5 weeks, we divided tasks into trello cards and we exceeded expectations for the code written this week.\nWe successfully created APIs and rendered 500 fake seed data users. The front end was able to connect to the database and render the users.\nWe have also created multiple helper functions, integrate Material UI, refactored the codebase using React Hooks, built migrations, routes as well as authenticating the app with Auth0.\nI personally focused on the backend this week. I created routes, deployed to Heroku and added authentication with Auth0.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Labs: Week 1"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post-one/"}}
